#  Crypto Address Verifier in Rust

This project is a CLI tool written in Rust that analyzes cryptocurrency addresses to determine which blockchain standards they adhere to (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.). The verifier accepts one or more addresses and filters out invalid or malformed inputs.

##  Purpose

The main goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of:
- Rust's strengths in parsing and error handling
- Pattern matching and string processing
- Blockchain address formats and validation rules
- Building efficient CLI tools

This tool is being developed as part of my learning journey in systems programming and blockchain infrastructure.

##  Features

- ✅ Detects valid address formats for major chains (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL)
- ✅ Filters out invalid or malformed input
- ⏳ Planned: batch processing of address lists
- ⏳ Planned: automatic blockchain classification for mixed inputs

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Rust** (CLI and logic)
- **Regex / pattern matching**
- **Planned extensions**: CSV or JSON input/output support
